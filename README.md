The point of this repository is to consolidate all of the club's knowledge into a nice, neat website where new members of the club can refer to and quickly get started with our current and ongoing projects. The website will cover everything, from regular club meetings, to setting up a personal lab using virtual machines, to more advanced topics like Bash/Powershell scripting and ethical hacking techniques.
